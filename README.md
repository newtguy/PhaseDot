# Overview

PhaseDot is an action-arcade game built to explore and expand my skills as a software engineer in game development. The project emphasizes smooth player movement, responsive input handling (keyboard and controller), and dynamic game elements like enemies and collectibles.

In PhaseDot, the player controls a dot navigating a neon-themed arena. The goal is to collect items while avoiding enemies that spawn progressively as more collectibles are collected. The game starts with a countdown, and the challenge increases with each new enemy. Players can use either keyboard or a game controller to move the dot around the screen.

The purpose of writing PhaseDot was to practice game mechanics programming, input management, collision detection, and dynamic object spawning in Python using the Arcade library. It also provided hands-on experience in structuring a game project with modular code and clean architecture.

# Future Work

* Implement level design and level generator.
* Add "phase shift" player ability which swaps level plane to an alternate plane with other obstacles and enemies.
* Add multiple collectible types with different effects (speed boosts, shields, score multipliers).
* Include audio effects and background music for a more immersive experience.  
* Implement a high-score leaderboard View.  
* Publish game to steam workshop.
